### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Hello! 
I'm Lee Seung-min, a front-end developer who is constantly improving and working hard. As I create a service, I feel that I am growing when I look at the web page that I made, and when I work with my team members and team projects, I feel that I am developing in that atmosphere. My belief seems to be programming with the belief, "Modesty when dealing with people, confidence when dealing with my work."

Today, I hope to be a diverse and wide web developer.
